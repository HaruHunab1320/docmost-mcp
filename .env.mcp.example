# MCP Bridge Environment Configuration
# 
# NOTE: The current architecture has a design flaw - it expects hardcoded
# user and workspace IDs, which doesn't work for multi-user systems.
# 
# TODO: The MCP bridge should be refactored to:
# 1. Use only the API key for authentication
# 2. Derive user/workspace context from the API key itself
# 3. Not require hardcoded IDs in environment variables
#
# Current (flawed) configuration:
# MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3333
# MCP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# MCP_USER_ID=hardcoded_user_id  # This shouldn't be needed!
# MCP_WORKSPACE_ID=hardcoded_workspace_id  # This shouldn't be needed!
# MCP_USER_EMAIL=user@example.com  # This shouldn't be needed!
#
# Proper configuration should be:
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3333
MCP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# The API key should contain all necessary context
