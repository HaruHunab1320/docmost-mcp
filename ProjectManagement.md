# Project Management Features Implementation

## Current State

Docmost currently supports basic task management through the editor with the following features:

### Basic Task Management
- **Task Lists (To-Do Lists)**: 
  - The editor includes a built-in TaskList extension from TipTap
  - Users can create task lists with checkable items
  - Tasks support nesting for subtasks
  - Tasks can be marked as complete/incomplete with checkboxes

- **Task Creation Methods**:
  - Through the slash menu command: "/to-do list"
  - Via the bubble menu node selector
  - Tasks are stored as part of the page content in JSON format

### Current Limitations

- **No Dedicated Task Database**:
  - Tasks are stored as content within pages, not as separate database entities
  - No specific database tables for tasks, projects, or task assignments
  - No way to track tasks across pages or assign them to team members

- **No Advanced Project Management**:
  - No dedicated project templates or project spaces
  - No task dependencies, deadlines, or priority settings
  - No Kanban boards, Gantt charts, or sprint planning features
  - No task assignment or team member allocation

- **No Task Aggregation**:
  - No way to view all tasks across workspaces/spaces
  - No dashboards specifically for task tracking
  - No reminders or notifications for task deadlines

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema (✅ Completed)
- [x] Create `projects` table
- [x] Create `tasks` table with relationships to pages/users
- [x] Create `task_assignments` table (implemented as columns in tasks table)
- [x] Create `task_labels` table
- [x] Design database indices for efficient queries
- [x] Create repositories for project and task entities
- [x] Register repositories in the appropriate modules

### Phase 2: Core API (✅ Completed)
- [x] Create Project service with CRUD operations
- [x] Create Task service with CRUD operations
- [x] Implement task assignment functionality
- [x] Implement complex task queries and filtering
- [x] Create Project and Task controllers
- [x] Create DTO files for request validation
- [x] Create endpoints for task aggregation across spaces
- [x] Add due date and reminder functionality
- [x] Implement task conversion from document content

### Phase 3: UI Components (✅ Completed)
- [x] Project management page component
- [x] Create project list view with filtering options
- [x] Implement project creation and editing modals
- [x] Create project board view (Kanban style)
- [x] Create task detail modal
- [x] Implement task assignment UI
- [x] Add date pickers for deadlines
- [x] Implement drag and drop for tasks
- [x] Create project overview dashboard

### Phase 4: Integration (⏳ Not Started)
- [ ] Connect task lists in documents with task database
- [ ] Add task extraction from document content
- [ ] Implement task synchronization between views
- [ ] Create task mentions in documents
- [ ] Add notifications for task assignments and deadlines

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (⏳ Not Started)
- [ ] Add project templates
- [ ] Implement time tracking
- [ ] Add task dependencies
- [ ] Create reporting views
- [ ] Implement task automation rules
- [ ] Add calendar integration
